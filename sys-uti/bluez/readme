Kernel Configuration:

If you are building this package to use bluetooth devices (rather than as a build
dependency), enable the following options in the kernel configuration, also the
options below the next paragraph if you intend to run the tests, and recompile the
kernel if necessary:

General setup --->
  # If it is disabled, [TIMERFD] and [EVENTFD] will be hidden and
  # enabled implicitly.  We DO NOT recommend to enable [EXPERT]
  # unless you are really an expert user:
  [ /*] Configure standard kernel features (expert users) --->          [EXPERT]
    [*] Enable timerfd() system call                                   [TIMERFD]
    [*] Enable eventfd() system call                                   [EVENTFD]

[*] Networking support --->                                                [NET]

    <*/M>   HIDP protocol support                                      [BT_HIDP]
    Bluetooth device drivers --->
      # Select the appropriate drivers for your bluetooth hardware.
      # There are more vendor-specific drivers not listed here:
      < /*/M> HCI USB driver                                       [BT_HCIBTUSB]
