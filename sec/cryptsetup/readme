Kernel Configuration

Encrypted block devies require kernel support. To use it, the appropriate kernel configuration parameters need to be set:

Device Drivers --->
  [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->                   [MD]
    <*/M> Device mapper support                                     [BLK_DEV_DM]
